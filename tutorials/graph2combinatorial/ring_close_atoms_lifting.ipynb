    "We implement a lifting from a molecule graph to a combinatorial complex based on two points:\n",
    "- The ring information of the molecule. Rings will be represented as 2-cells in the combinatorial complex.\n",
    "- The distance between atoms in the molecule. Distances between atoms will be computed. If the atoms are under a predefined threshold, they will be considered as close and groupped together. This clusters will be introduced as hyperedges in the combinatorial complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, attributes inspired by those used in [(Battiloro et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15429) are incorporated into the elements, enhancing the representation of the molecule.\n",
    "The attributes are:\n",
    "- **Node**: Atom type, atomic number, and chirality.\n",
    "- **Edge**: Bond type, conjugation and stereochemistry.\n",
    "- **Close atoms groups**: Conjugation, hydrophobicity, electrophilicity, nucleophilicity, and polarity.\n",
    "- **Rings**: Ring size, aromaticity, heteroatoms, saturation, hydrophobicity, electrophilicity, nucleophilicity, and polarity.\n",

    "The notebook is divided into sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Loading the dataset](#loading-the-dataset) loads the config files for the loading QM9 dataset and a ring-based tranformation, creates a dataset object and visualizes it.\n",
    "- [Loading and applying the lifting](#loading-and-applying-the-lifting) defines a simple neural network to test that the lifting creates the expected incidence matrices.\n",
    "- [Create and run a simplicial nn model](#create-and-run-a-simplicial-nn-model) simply runs a forward pass of the model to check that everything is working as expected.\n",
